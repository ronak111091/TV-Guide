Developed a Client user interface using KnockoutJS and JQuery which consumes REST APIs exposed by http://themoviedb.org/

REST API's documentation  - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3
	
-How to use the site:
I intend to build a movie/TV DB app where you can browse through movies and tv shows.
The site has 3 tabs and a home button.
In the home screen you will find latest TV shows and Movies
Discover tab allows you to search movies according to selected categories.
In Movies tab you can select popular, upcoming, now playing and top rated categories to browse movies.
You can select any movie to see details.

I have used knockout.js to implement MVVM architecture. http://knockoutjs.com/index.html
Knockout.js provides:
	Clear separation of concerns,
	Two way data binding,
	Dependency tracking.

I have also used the revealing module design pattern to better structure the code. check discover.js and movies.js
	
-Future work:
I intend to continue working on the app and finish the TV show functionalities
